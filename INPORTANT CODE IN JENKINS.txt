INPORTANT CODE IN JENKINS

  ***INSTALL IN JENKINS IN CENTOS***
Now let us install Jenkins on the centos-host machine and configure it to run on port 8090 instead of the default port 8080.
You can refer to the Jenkins Installation Docs located above the terminal.

=== To install jenkins run the following command
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk -y
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo --no-check-certificate
sudo rpm --import http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum install jenkins -y

Edit /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service file and change Jenkins port to 8090 by updating Environment="JENKINS_PORT=" variable value.

sudo vi /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service

It should look like this:
Environment="JENKINS_PORT=8090"

===to start jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins

  ***LINKING JENKINS CLI WITH YOUR TERMINAL SSH PUBLIC KEY***
===Log in your jenkins-cli.
===click on user name
===click on configure
===ssh keygen
===go to your terminal cat /home/godwin/ssh/id_rsa.pub
===copy the key 
===add your ssh public key

=== TO INSTALL JANKINS-CLI.JAR(this will enable to work with jenkins on your terminal)
wget http://localhost:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar

 java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ -auth godwin:11222f2c304a5d3accca946a69a0464545

adding up -auth your name and token will enable to gain assess.

=== TO START WORKING JEKINS IN YOUR TERMINAL ADD -WEBSOCKET THEN AGURUMENT EG...

java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ -auth godwin:11222f2c304a5d3accca946a69a0464545 -webSocket list-jobs

*To configure SSH service in Jenkins to listen on a fixed port. To find out the port in use, run the command below:
	curl -Lv http://localhost:8085/login 2>&1 | grep -i 'x-ssh-endpoint'

*To interact with a user in jenkins: let us begin interacting with Jenkins over ssh with the user mike.
	mike@jenkins-server:~$ ssh -i /home/mike/.ssh/jenkins_key -l mike -p 8022 jenkins-server help
		
		Keep a note of the options used with the SSH command:

		-i flag is used to point to mike's private SSH key. Remember, we have already added the public key in the 		Jenkins configuration.
		-l is the login user which in our example is mike
		-p is the port which we found out in the previous step to be 		 8022

	
ssh -i /home/mike/.ssh/jenkins_key -l mike -p 8022 jenkins-server help

***SYSTEM ADMINISTERING WITH JENKINS***
The basic include:
	-Backup
	-Restore
	-Moritor
	-Scale
	-Manage

===BACKUP AND RESTOR IN JENKINS
The 3 backup file include:
	            *Jenkins-home
                  |--------|-------|
                  |                | 
 *configuration file	         *job
  (config.xml)


	To back up jenkins, a Thinbackup plugin is us
-once the thinbackup plugin is install
-run (service jenkins restart) to restart jenkins after your plugin installation 
-click on THINBACKUP folder at the down end of manage jenkins
-open your matchine and creat a backup folder (eg. jenkins-backup)
 -give the folder access to read and write
-run pwd and copy the path 
-add the path you have copied to thinbackup which you will find from the setting
- save the file 
-click on backup
-in your matchine cd to the folder you have created and list the file you will see the backup folder.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
===To reture jenkins 
-click on reture select the where you which to reture from and click on enter.


***MORINTORING JENKINS***
To achive this you have to install morintoring plugins
-install prometheum metrics
-restart jenkins
-open prometheus 
-click on status
-select target

NOTE: before you get prometheus runing you can link it with your cloud proveder instance, this can be Azure or AWS.



Let us now add a scrape config for Jenkins. Update the prometheus configuration file located at /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml and add the following config under the scrape_configs section:


- job_name: 'Jenkins'
    metrics_path: /prometheus/
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8085']


Once the file is updated, restart prometheus using the below command:

service prometheus restart 


Wait for few seconds before submitting your question.


Note: Here localhost:8085 refers to our Jenkins Controller and the /prometheus/ metrics path is exposed by the prometheus-metrics plugin that we installed previously`


SOLUTION
1. Edit /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file

vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml



2. Under scrape_configs section add

- job_name: 'Jenkins'
    metrics_path: /prometheus/
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8085']


3. Then save the file

4. Restart Prometheus Service:

service prometheus restart

To see the status of the configuration we used within /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml file, refresh the Prometheus UI and then navigate to the drop down button called Status and click on Configuration.

Here, you should be able to see the global configuration and configuration for specific targets such as Prometheus and Jenkins.


Now lets test out some queries in Prometheus. Go back to the Prometheus home page (by clicking on the Prometheus button within the UI) and execute the following query:

jenkins_job_count_value
What value you got in the output?

SOLUTION

1. Click on the Prometheus button on the top of the terminal.

2. Enter the query under Expression

jenkins_job_count_value



3. Then click on Execute button.

4. Look for the Value of the Element.



Let us see now, how we can use Grafana to visualise Jenkins metrics. Grafana is already installed and can be accessed using Grafana button on the top of the terminal.

Grafana credentials are:

UserName: admin

Password: admin


Note:Set a new password admin123 for the admin user.



First of all, let us add Prometheus datasource in Grafana. Follow below given steps for that:

-> Login into Grafana and click on Add your first datasource.

-> Then select Prometheus and enter http://localhost:9090 in the URL box.

-> Finally click on Save and test button at the bottom.

-> Click on Grafana logo to move back to the dashboard.



Let us create a dashboard in Grafana now to visualise the total number of Jenkins jobs.


Use same Grafana credentials to login:

UserName: admin

Password: admin123


Follow below given steps to create a dashboard in Grafana:


-> Login into Grafana and click on Create your first dashboard.

-> Then click on Add visualization and at the bottom enter jenkins_job_count_value in the Metrics browser box.

-> Make sure Prometheus is selected as the Data source.

-> On the right side under Panel options, enter Jenkins Jobs Count in Title.

-> Click on Apply button on the top right corner.

-> Finally click on the Save dashboard button (second button on the top right).

-> Enter dashboard name as Jenkins and save it.


As per the Grafana dashboard, how many Jenkins jobs are there?


Make sure to look for the latest metrics in the dashboard. For that click on the time navigator option on the top right and then select Last 5 minutes.

Note: Close and open the Grafana again if no changes are reflecting and wait a little as sometimes changes can take few seconds to reflect.

5. Once installed click on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running.


You can access the BlueOcean UI either by directly opening the <jenkins-url>/blue URL or by clicking on the Open Blue Ocean option, on the left side of Jenkins dashboard.
----------------------------------------



Create a pipeline in BlueOcean as per details mentioned below:


1. Although source code is hosted on GitHub, but select Git under Where do you store your code to avoid token requirements.

2. Repository URL is https://github.com/kodekloudhub/go-webapp-sample.git.

3. Leave the Username and Password blank.




solution
Login into the Jenkins server and follow the below given steps:


1. Click on Open Blue Ocean.

2 If you get a Welcome to Jenkins pop-up then click on Create a new Pipeline option, otherwise click on New Pipeline option under Pipelines.

3. Under Where do you store your code?, click on Git.

4. Enter the repository URL i.e https://github.com/kodekloudhub/go-webapp-sample.git.

5. Leave the Username and Password blank and click on Create Pipeline.

6. It will take few seconds and go-webapp-sample pipeline will be created automatically because this repository already contains a Jenkinsfile.

JENKINS SECURITY

Which section of the web UI allows a Jenkins administrator to enable, configure, or disable key security features which apply to the entire Jenkins environment? securty

Which among the following is the primary mechanism for securing a Jenkins environment against unauthorized usage? Acess control

Using both the Security Realm and Authorization configurations it is possible to configure very relaxed or very rigid authentication and authorization schemes in Jenkins.

-----------------------------------------------
Let's extend some Authorization capabilities of Jenkins to support even more authorization schemes.
Install Role-based Authorization plugin.


Note:

Observe the new available options under Authorization using the standard Manage Jenkins > Security screen after the plugin installation.

SOLUTION
Plugins can be installed using Plugins Manager through the standard Manage Jenkins > Plugins screen.

By default, Jenkins run its builds on the built-in node. It is done to make smooth transition towards learning Jenkins but is inadvisable in long term.
It is due to the fact that any builds running on the built-in node have the same level of access to the controller file system as the Jenkins process.


--------------------------------------------------------
Configure Jenkins to prevent builds from running on the Built-In Node directly?

SOLUTION
Navigate to Manage Jenkins Â» Manage Nodes and Clouds screen and change the number of Executors to 0 for the Built-In Node.

PROJECT
Jenkins server is already installed and it's running on port 8085. You can access the same using Jenkins button on the top bar. Login into the Jenkins server using below given credentials:


Username: bob

Password: bob321


Apart from this there is a Gitea server installed, which has a repository named go-app. This repository has two branches dev and master, you will get to know about their usage in the next question. You can access the Gitea server using Gitea button on the top bar. Login into the Gitea server using below given credentials:


Username: bob

Password: bob123


Notes:


1. You might need to restart Jenkins service after installing some plugins or after making some configuration changes etc. In such case please make sure Jenkins service is back up before you submit your solution.


2. Please make a note of Jenkins credentials given above.


--------------------------------------------------------

Our application development team has recently finished the MVP development for one of the applications and it's ready to be deployed on production.

The go-app repository on the Gitea server contains the source code of this application. The dev branch of this repository is used for testing, hence we want to deploy it on the dev environment and the master branch should be deployed on the production environment.


On dev server /opt/go-app is the document root of the application and we have already setup the dev branch over there for your convenience. In your build step, you will just need to pull the latest dev branch code from the repository using git pull command. You can access the dev server using below given credentials:


Host: gotest-dev01

User: bob

Password: caleston123


Similarly on production server /opt/go-app is the document root of the application and we have already setup the master branch over there for your convenience. In your build step, you will just need to pull the latest master branch code from the repository using git pull command. You can access the production server using below given credentials:


Host: gotest-prod01

User: bob

Password: caleston123


Create a pipeline job in Jenkins, and configure it as per details mentioned below:


Prerequisites:

-> Install the required plugins which are needed for adding SSH agent nodes and for creating pipeline jobs.

-> Add dev and production servers as SSH node agents in Jenkins.

-> You can use /opt as the Remote root directory for both of these nodes to avoid any permission issues.

-> To make nodes work, you will also need to add the respective credentials in Jenkins for these servers.


Job configuration:

-> The job name should be go-app-deployment

-> It must be a pipeline job.

-> The first stage here should be to build the dev branch code which must be deployed on the dev server/environment, you can name the stage as per your choice. As we have already setup the repo/branch on the server so you will just need to run the git pull command.

Here is a hint, how you can make it run on the dev server. To do so, add an agent configuration in each of your stages like this:

stage('Build Dev') {
    agent {
        label {
            label 'dev'
            customWorkspace "/opt/go-app"
        }
    }
    steps {
        sh 'git pull'
    }
}


Please note that label 'dev' is the label you will give to your node (so update it accordingly) and you will need to set customWorkspace "/opt/go-app" (its same for both of the servers/environments) to make it work on this setup/back-end.


-> The second stage should be to run some unit tests (again you can name the stage as per your choice). You can execute the tests using a stage like:

stage('Test Dev') {
    agent {
        label {
            label 'dev'
            customWorkspace "/opt/go-app"
        }
    }
    steps {
        sh 'go test ./...'
    }
}



-> The last stage for dev would be to deploy the application. You can use a stage like:

stage('Deploy Dev') {
    agent {
        label {
            label 'dev'
            customWorkspace "/opt/go-app"
        }
    }
    steps {
        script {
            withEnv ( ['JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE=do_not_kill'] ) {
                sh 'go run main.go &'
            }
        }
    }
}


You must have noticed an extra parameter in this stage i.e withEnv ( ['JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE=do_not_kill'] ), it is needed to make sure Jenkins doesn't kill the background process we are starting in this stage on the respective server.


-> Similarly configure the same stages (with different name and prod specific values) for the production deployment. So the pipeline will have total 6 stages (three for each environment).

-> Make sure to build the job at least once and make sure its building successfully.

        }
        //PROD
        stage('Build Prod') {
            agent {
              label {
                label 'prod'
                customWorkspace "/opt/go-app"
              }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'git pull'
            }
        }

}


5. Finally save the job and build.



Once deployed, you should be able to access the dev and production applications using Dev App and Prod App buttons respectively on the top of the terminal. The credentials are as below:

Dev:

User: test

Password: test


Production:

User: appuser

Password: app321
